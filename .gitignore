Industrial systems like chemical plants, oil refineries, and smart manufacturing units run continuously, producing high-frequency sensor data streams that measure temperature, pressure, flow rates, vibration, voltage, and many other signals. Any deviation from normal operation — whether due to equipment malfunction, human error, cyber-attack, or unexpected external factors — can result in costly downtime, product quality issues, or safety hazards.

Traditional rule-based and threshold monitoring systems often fail because:

They cannot adapt to dynamic operating conditions.

They do not capture multivariate relationships (how one sensor influences another).

They produce too many false alarms, causing “alarm fatigue” among operators.

To overcome these challenges, our proposed solution is an AI-powered anomaly detection system that can:

Automatically learn normal operating behavior from historical plant data.

Detect anomalies in real time when data deviates from expected patterns.

Provide interpretable results by identifying which sensors contributed most to the anomaly.

Generate actionable insights for plant operators and engineers to act before failure occurs.

The pipeline consists of:

Preprocessing: Missing value handling, resampling, normalization, outlier suppression.

Feature Engineering: Rolling windows, lag features, correlation analysis, statistical summaries.

Model Training: Multiple anomaly detection models (classical ML + deep learning).

Anomaly Scoring: Generating a normalized anomaly score (0–100).

Root Cause Analysis: Identifying top contributing features for each anomaly.

Visualization & Reporting: Creating time-series anomaly plots and structured reports for operators.

This makes the solution end-to-end automated, requiring minimal human intervention, while still offering interpretability for trust and adoption.
